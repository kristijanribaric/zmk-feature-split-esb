# zmk-feature-split-esb

Enhanced ShockBurst (2.4 GHz) split transport for ZMK. One peripheral, one central.
Packet-native: one ESB packet = one split message; ESB hardware ACK + retransmit +
CRC handle reliability.

## Install

Add it to your `config/west.yml`; `import: true` pulls the deps a vanilla ZMK
workspace lacks (`zmk` and Zephyr come from your own manifest):
```yaml
  remotes:
    - name: damex
      url-base: https://github.com/damex
  projects:
    - name: zmk-feature-split-esb
      remote: damex
      revision: v0.1.1
      import: true
```
Then update and apply the Kconfig fixes `sdk-nrf` needs on ZMK's Zephyr:
```
west update
west patch -sm zmk-feature-split-esb apply
```
For a local checkout, build with `-DZMK_EXTRA_MODULES=<path>/zmk-feature-split-esb`
instead; your workspace must then already provide `sdk-nrf` + `nrfxlib` with the
patches applied.

## Configure

Board/shield conf, select ESB and drop the other transports:
```conf
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT=y
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE=n
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_WIRED=n
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_ESB=y
```
Central also sets `CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL=y`; peripheral leaves it unset.

Same link identity in a dtsi included by both sides:
```dts
esb_link: esb_link {
    compatible = "zmk,split-esb";
    base-address = [E7 E7 E7 E7];
    prefix = <0xC2>;
    rf-channel = <4>;
};
```

| DT property | Value |
|---|---|
| `base-address` | 4-byte bytestring `[..]`, pipe 0 |
| `prefix` | 1 byte, pipe 0 |
| `rf-channel` | 0-100 (2400 + N MHz) |
| `lossy-codes` | optional list of `<INPUT_EV_* code>` pairs sent without ACK |

Lossy-codes lists the input axes the peripheral fires-and-forgets. Reserve for
high-rate, self-correcting axes (pointer motion). Non-input split events
(key-position, sensor, battery) are always ACK'd; every input event is ACK'd
unless its (type, code) is listed here. Omitted = fully lossless link. Example
for a mouse:
```dts
#include <zephyr/dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h>
&esb_link {
    lossy-codes
        = <INPUT_EV_REL INPUT_REL_X>
        , <INPUT_EV_REL INPUT_REL_Y>;
};
```

Tunables (Kconfig, defaults shown):

| Option | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_BITRATE_2MBPS` / `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_BITRATE_1MBPS` | 2 Mbps | link rate |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_TX_POWER_DBM` | 0 | boot TX power; raise for range |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_RETRANSMIT_COUNT` | 3 | retransmits before drop |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_RETRANSMIT_DELAY_US` | 600 | delay between retransmits |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_MAX_PAYLOAD` | 48 | max on-air bytes (>= largest split msg) |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_RX_QUEUE_SIZE` | 16 | RX packet queue depth |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_REPLY_QUEUE_SIZE` | 8 | central reverse-channel queue depth |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_TX_FIFO_SIZE` | 8 | radio TX FIFO depth |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_RX_FIFO_SIZE` | 8 | radio RX FIFO depth |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_PRIORITY` | 50 | transport registration priority |

## Limitations

`ZMK_SPLIT_CENTRAL_PERIPHERAL_COUNT` is 0 on an ESB-only central (ZMK derives it
from BLE/wired counts). Events still deliver, but:

- Commands to the peripheral need `BEHAVIOR_LOCALITY_EVENT_SOURCE`, source = its id.
- No `BEHAVIOR_LOCALITY_GLOBAL` broadcast or HID-indicator forwarding (both index that count).

## License

This module is MIT.

Workspace dependencies pulled by `west.yml`. Each keeps its own license:

| Dependency | License |
|---|---|
| ZMK | MIT |
| Zephyr | Apache-2.0 |
| sdk-nrf | LicenseRef-Nordic-5-Clause |
| nrfxlib | LicenseRef-Nordic-5-Clause (parts this module's builds touch: MPSL, softdevice_controller) |

The `LicenseRef-Nordic-5-Clause` parts restrict use to Nordic hardware.

For an ESB-only build the link symbols come from sdk-nrf.
nrfxlib is still cloned into your workspace and gets linked if you also enable BLE.

Patches under `zephyr/patches/nrf/` modify sdk-nrf files (Nordic-licensed) and
apply on the user side via `west patch`. They don't redistribute Nordic source.
`patches.yml` lists upstream versions after which each patch can be dropped.
