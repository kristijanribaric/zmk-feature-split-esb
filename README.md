# zmk-feature-split-esb

Enhanced ShockBurst (2.4 GHz) split transport for ZMK. One or more peripherals, one central.
Packet-native: split messages map to ESB packets (a report's input events
coalesce into one, each packed to a compact on-air form), carried over a
lock-free SPSC RX path.
ESB hardware ACK + retransmit + CRC handle reliability.

## Install

Add it to your `config/west.yml`. `import: true` pulls the deps a vanilla ZMK
workspace lacks (`zmk` and Zephyr come from your own manifest):
```yaml
  remotes:
    - name: damex
      url-base: https://github.com/damex
  projects:
    - name: zmk-feature-split-esb
      remote: damex
      revision: v0.3.6
      import: true
```
Then update and apply the Kconfig fixes `sdk-nrf` needs on ZMK's Zephyr:
```
west update
west patch -sm zmk-feature-split-esb apply
```
For a local checkout, build with `-DZMK_EXTRA_MODULES=<path>/zmk-feature-split-esb`
instead. Your workspace must then already provide `sdk-nrf` + `nrfxlib` with the
patches applied.

## Configure

Board/shield conf, select ESB and drop the other transports:
```conf
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT=y
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE=n
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_WIRED=n
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_ESB=y
CONFIG_ESB_MAX_PAYLOAD_LENGTH=48
```
Central also sets `CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL=y`. Peripheral leaves it unset.

Set `CONFIG_ESB_MAX_PAYLOAD_LENGTH` to at least `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_MAX_PAYLOAD` (48).
Module defaults it, but sdk-nrf default (32) can win on Kconfig parse order, so set
it explicitly on every device. Build assert catches value too small for largest
split message.

DT side: shared dtsi every device includes, plus role-specific lines. Everything
reports to the dongle (central). Two examples, by peripheral count and what each
sources.

### One peripheral: a mouse

Pointer motion: input events, routed by one `zmk,input-split` per pipe.

Shared (`esb_shared.dtsi`), every device:
```dts
/ {
    esb_link {
        compatible = "zmk,split-esb";
        base-address = [E7 D3 9A 5C];
        hop-channels = [04];
        peripherals {
            mouse: peripheral_mouse {
                pipe = <0>;
                prefix = <0x4B>;
                weight = <1>;
            };
        };
    };

    split_inputs {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        mouse_split: mouse_split@0 {
            compatible = "zmk,input-split";
            reg = <0>;
        };
    };

    mouse_listener: mouse_listener {
        compatible = "zmk,input-listener";
        status = "disabled";
        device = <&mouse_split>;
    };
};
```
Dongle (central): enable listener.
```dts
#include "esb_shared.dtsi"
&mouse_listener { status = "okay"; };
```
Mouse (peripheral): claim pipe, bind sensor.
```dts
#include "esb_shared.dtsi"
/ { chosen { zmk,esb-self = &mouse; }; };
&mouse_split { device = <&your_sensor>; };
```
Two mice, same shape: second child, second `mouse_split@1` and listener. Each mouse
binds its own split, disables the others.

### Two peripherals: a split keyboard

Both halves are peripherals, report to the dongle, never to each other. Key positions
ride the transport directly, no input-split. Left pipe 0, right pipe 1.

Shared (`esb_shared.dtsi`):
```dts
/ {
    esb_link {
        compatible = "zmk,split-esb";
        base-address = [E7 D3 9A 5C];
        hop-channels = [04];
        peripherals {
            left: peripheral_left {
                pipe = <0>;
                prefix = <0x4B>;
                weight = <1>;
            };
            right: peripheral_right {
                pipe = <1>;
                prefix = <0xC3>;
                weight = <1>;
            };
        };
    };
};
```
Dongle (central): holds keymap and matrix transform spanning both halves, standard
ZMK split. Key positions deliver natively, no per-key listener.
```dts
#include "esb_shared.dtsi"
```
Left half (peripheral): claim pipe 0, own kscan.
```dts
#include "esb_shared.dtsi"
/ { chosen { zmk,esb-self = &left; }; };
```
Right half (peripheral): claim pipe 1.
```dts
#include "esb_shared.dtsi"
/ { chosen { zmk,esb-self = &right; }; };
```
Keys deliver, but peripheral-count limit below applies: no global-behavior broadcast,
no HID-indicator forwarding.

| DT property | Value |
|---|---|
| `base-address` | 4-byte bytestring `[..]`, shared by all pipes |
| `address-length` | on-air address bytes 3/4/5, shorter trims airtime, weakens selectivity, all devices must match (default 5) |
| `peripherals` | one child node per peripheral: `pipe`, `prefix` (1 byte), `weight`, `reply-queue-depth` (central reverse-channel backlog for this pipe, default 8) |
| `hop-channels` | channel bytestring, each 0-100 (2400 + N MHz). 1 = fixed, 2+ = hopping set |
| `hop-anchors` | unmaskable rendezvous set, a subset of hop-channels (default 76, 79, 82). Pick channels clear of local WiFi |
| `hop-threshold` | graded loss before acting: central hop-vote sum, peripheral sweep streak; fully-lost window scores 4 (default 6) |
| `hop-window-ms` | peripheral keepalive period while data flows (default 32) |
| `rssi-floor-dbm` | central counts a served peripheral's motion weaker than this (dBm) as a degraded window (default -85) |
| `idle-keepalive-ms` | peripheral idle keepalive period, also central hop-decision window (default 128) |
| `peripheral-timeout-ms` | silence before the central releases a peripheral's held state (default 3000) |
| `tx-power-dbm` | boot TX power in dBm, raise for range (default 0) |
| `retransmit-count` | retransmits before drop (default 3) |
| `retransmit-delay-us` | delay between retransmits (default 600) |
| `use-fast-ramp-up` | shorter radio ramp-up, nRF52/nRF53, all peripherals must match the central |
| `crc-bits` | CRC width 0/8/16, all peripherals must match the central (default 16) |
| `bitrate-kbps` | radio bitrate 1000/2000, all peripherals must match the central (default 2000) |
| `lossy-codes` | optional list of `<INPUT_EV_* code>` pairs sent without ACK |

Lossy-codes lists the input axes peripherals fire-and-forget. Reserve for
high-rate, self-correcting axes (pointer motion). Non-input split events
(key-position, sensor, battery) are always ACK'd. Every input event is ACK'd
unless its (type, code) is listed here. Omitted = fully lossless link. Example
for a mouse:
```dts
#include <zephyr/dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h>
&esb_link {
    lossy-codes
        = <INPUT_EV_REL INPUT_REL_X>
        , <INPUT_EV_REL INPUT_REL_Y>;
};
```

Tunables (Kconfig, defaults shown):

| Option | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_MAX_PAYLOAD` | 48 | max on-air bytes (>= largest split msg) |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_RX_QUEUE_SIZE` | 16 | RX SPSC ring depth (power of 2) |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_RX_THREAD_STACK_SIZE` | 1536 | RX dispatch thread stack (decode + input forward; behavior-bound events run on the system workqueue) |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_RX_THREAD_PRIORITY` | 2 | RX dispatch thread priority |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE` | 16 | central queue for key/sensor/battery events bound for the system workqueue |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_COMMAND_QUEUE_SIZE` | 8 | peripheral queue for inbound central commands |
| `ZMK_SPLIT_ESB_PRIORITY` | 50 | transport registration priority |

## Lost-event reconcile

Key events are ACK'd, but the radio gives up after `retransmit-count` tries, so a
press or release can still die in a bad-RF moment. Each peripheral keepalive
carries its pressed-position bitmap; the central diffs it against its own view and
replays the lost transitions. A stuck key heals within one keepalive period
(`hop-window-ms` while typing, `idle-keepalive-ms` at idle). The live stream is
healed too: an orphan release (lost press) drops before ZMK sees it, a repeated
press synthesizes its lost release first. Keepalives run on single-channel links
too. Positions 64 and above are not covered.

A peripheral silent past `peripheral-timeout-ms` (sleep, dead battery, out of
range) gets its held keys and input-split buttons released, the connectionless
equivalent of a disconnect. If it returns with a key still physically held, its
first keepalive re-presses it.

## Channel hopping

List two or more channels in `hop-channels` and the link hops between them, stepping
off a channel that degrades. The central drives the hop: it counts a served
peripheral's window bad when motion goes missing or arrives weaker than
`rssi-floor-dbm`, and a weighted vote across peripherals (`hop-threshold`) moves the
whole link to the next channel. A peripheral that loses the central sweeps the list
to re-find it, sweeping faster the more its acked transmits retried. One channel is a
fixed link, no hopping. Every peripheral must carry the central's list, so flash them
as a set.

A few channels (the anchors) are held unmaskable, the rendezvous set both ends meet on
when the link is lost. `hop-anchors` picks them, default 76, 79, 82. The engine can never
mask an anchor, so pick channels clear of local WiFi, otherwise the link rendezvouses on
contended spectrum. The rest of the pool carries data, AFH drops the channels that
perform badly.

## Load order

Each step overrides the previous:

1. **Boot defaults:** the DT props program the radio at startup.
2. **Saved values:** any persisted in NVS apply on top (needs `CONFIG_SETTINGS`).
3. **Live changes:** pushed at runtime via `settings_runtime_set`, no reflash.

Runtime-overridable keys: `esb/tx_power`, `esb/retransmit_count`, `esb/retransmit_delay`.

## Status API

Read-only link state for display widgets and diagnostics, declared in
`include/zmk_split_esb.h`:

```c
#include <zmk_split_esb.h>

struct zmk_split_esb_status status;
zmk_split_esb_get_status(&status);
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `channel` | current RF channel |
| `epoch` | hop generation |
| `searching` | link degraded, hunting for the peer |
| `rssi_dbm` | received signal: central reports worst sampled peripheral link, peripheral its central link |

`rssi_dbm` reads 0 until the first packet arrives.

Per-link signal on a multi-peripheral central: `zmk_split_esb_pipe_count()` plus
`zmk_split_esb_pipe_rssi_dbm(pipe)`, indexed by ESB pipe. A peripheral has only
index 0.

## Limitations

`ZMK_SPLIT_CENTRAL_PERIPHERAL_COUNT` is 0 on an ESB-only central (ZMK derives it
from BLE/wired counts). Events still deliver, but:

- Commands to the peripheral need `BEHAVIOR_LOCALITY_EVENT_SOURCE`, source = its id.
- No `BEHAVIOR_LOCALITY_GLOBAL` broadcast or HID-indicator forwarding (both index that count).

The `LicenseRef-Nordic-5-Clause` parts restrict use to Nordic hardware.

For an ESB-only build the link symbols come from sdk-nrf.
nrfxlib is still cloned into your workspace and gets linked if you also enable BLE.

Patches under `zephyr/patches/nrf/` modify sdk-nrf files (Nordic-licensed) and
apply on the user side via `west patch`. They don't redistribute Nordic source.
`patches.yml` lists upstream versions after which each patch can be dropped.
